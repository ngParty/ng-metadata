# API Reference

> ng-metadata implements almost all Angular 2 API's ( high five !)
 
If you won't find something here, that exist in [angular.io docs](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/), that means it's not implemented by ng-metadata. 

If you think that should be back-ported to ng-metadata for even easier migration please raise a feature request!

API's are structured by module, followed by type of API ( decorator, class ).
