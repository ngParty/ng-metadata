# API Reference

> ng-metadata implements almost all Angular 2 API's ( high five !)

If you don't find something here, but which exists in [angular.io docs](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/), that means it's not implemented by ng-metadata.

If you think that should be back-ported to ng-metadata for even easier migration please submit a feature request!

API's are structured by module, followed by the type of API (decorator, class).
